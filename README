To run: 
make 
assemble {$FILE_NAME}

Will read in the contents of the file, and output the resulting location->byte mapping.

(Note, DEBUG in y86-assembler.c must be set to 0 to get proper output)


Note to Ben: 
- The results of the student tests are in the student test results folder





The only special case I didn't handle (that I could think of) was in the displacement vs register problem of mr/rm movq:

mrmovq #x1(%rax) %rax
vs
mrmovq #x1 %rax

To tell whether #x1 was a register or an offset, we would have to look ahead multiple characters, and so I just assumed the second situation would never occur.
